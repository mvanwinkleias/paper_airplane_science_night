# Paper Airplane Science Night

## Safety!

Please, PLEASE make sure you don't launch your airplanes at people.

Also, when we're done, we need to clean up.  You'll probably want to take your airplanes home though.

## Agenda

* Demonstrate how to make a few paper airplanes.
* Explain how the Scientific Method can be used to have MORE FUN... with PAPER AIRPLANES!

## Scientific Method!

This is a shortened (and, "simplified") outline of the Scientific Method, and how
it can be used to have FUN with PAPER AIRPLANES!!!

* Observe!
	* Paper airplanes can
		* Fly in straight paths
		* Fly in curved paths
		* Wobble when flying
		* Do loops
		* Crash!
		* More?
* Question!
	* Why does it fly that way?
* Hypothesize!
	* How can I make it fly differently?
* Experiment!
	* Make Testable Predictions!
		* What do you think happens when you put weight on different parts of the airplane?
	* Gather Data!
		* Write down the flight characteristics.
	* Refine!
		* Critique the work you've done.
* Develop General Theories
	* If I put a fold in a certain place, something happens.
	* If I put a weight in a certain place, something happens.
* Observe! (etc)

## Observables

Here are some things you can observe.  There are many more!

* How far does the airplane fly?
* How stable is the flight?
* How repeatable are your results?
* What happens to an airplane during a trial?
	* Damage?
	* Wear and tear?
	* Usable lifespan?

## Experiments!

### Target Practice

Set up an area for airplanes to be thrown at a target.

### Flight Range

* How far does it go?
* How much energy was put into the launch?
* Are the results repeatable?
* Can you predict how to get the airplane to fly a specific distance?
	* How good was your prediction?

### Design Your Own

It's all about having fun.  If you have fun safely, and you learn how to make
paper airplanes, that's good.

## Decorate

### Decorate a Folded Plane

* Make an airplane.
* Experiment with it. (How well does it fly?)
* Decorate it.
* Does it fly the same way after being decorated?

### Decorate an Unfolded Piece of Paper

* Map out the sections of paper that become the different parts of a plane.
* Decorate an unfolded piece of paper.
* Make your airplane.  Did the decorations come out where you wanted?
